# Pull Request (PR)

As stated by Github themselves [[link](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests)], pull request is a way to make a request to merge source branch into target branch. It can display differences between source and target, list of commits and additional information in the PR itself.

In this exercise, you will make a pull request from your own `3-pull-request` branch to this branch. However, just making a simple text file is easy. So, there is a challenge that you need to solve:
1. Bug: Unable to delete a job listing.
2. Feature change: Job listing card will show at max 90 characters before cutting it off and appending "..." characters into it. However, job listing with less than or equal to 90 characters will still have these characters appended. Make it so these three characters **and** "More" button didn't show if the description is less than 90 characters.

Once you have solved these challenges, make a pull request with:
1. Title: Short and Descriptive.
2. Description: Explain the issue, what caused it and what do you change.
3. ~~Reviewers: Assign it to me.~~
4. ~~Labels: Add label `bug` and `enhancement`.~~
